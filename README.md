# 🔧 Aki | Plugin Setup Developer Portfolio

Yo, I’m Aki – a hands-on Plugin Setup Dev who specializes in finding, testing, and customizing plugins to match a server’s unique vibe. I don’t just copy-paste configs – I **play, test, break, and rebuild** until it feels perfect.

## 🧪 Try Me Out

I work best when I can test live and tweak things as needed. I offer a **free trial setup** on your test server to show you what I can do.
